# lfm-healer

An android game where you act as the healer, keeping your party alive from onslaughts of different enemies. The actors are autonomous and stupid, they *will* stand in fire and you just have to deal with it.

The game uses a custom RPG ruleset, mainly inspired by the warcraft series but with additional stats from different MMORPGs. The game will reward pre-game tactical decisions, and poor performance will be punished. The game may allow for grinding and permanent loss of characters on death, but most metagame decisions haven't been made yet. As of now the focus is on getting the base mechanics down.

Some of the things that are implemented:

- XP and level scaling
- Stealth mechanics
- Stun/slow/invulnerability
- Projectiles
- Buffs/debuffs
- Map loader, debug tools
- Unit formations
